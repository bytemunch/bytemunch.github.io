<h1>A New Post</h1>
<h2>Life Update</h2>
<p>Been a while since I wrote a blog post and oh my, lot's has happened. I have a son now, which is awesome! So of course I've not been doing too much dev work, re-learning time management to work in bursts rather than long sessions is interesting. But not impossible.</p>
<h2>Blog Rework</h2>
<p>I've FINALLY reworked this blog system to automate shoving markdown files into the website. (Another reason for not posting, it was painful.) The new blog browser component has tag and title based search, which was easier to implement than I feared. Other notable changes are that it now holds all the post metadata in one JSON file, stores the actual post as HTML, and renames all the images to a representation of their hash so if I ever want to use an image in more than one post it won't take up loads of space. Probably save me like 200KB. Pog.</p>
<p>I still have a bunch of styling to do on the blog, but I do think I'll keep the minimal feel. I'll also probably add the post date in the navigation, and give some user feedback when there's no previous or next post to jump to. Other than that, it works well enough, shipped.</p>
<h2>Site tweaking</h2>
<p>I cleaned up a few of the outstanding bugs on the website, like incomplete fadeouts and general jankiness. There's still a bunch of TODOs but hey, at least there's some progress. I'm once again trying hard to resist the urge to tear it all down and start again with better programming practices, we'll see how that pans out though.</p>
<p>Next up for the site is a decent contact page with socials and all that, as well as actually associating socials to my 'brand'. Which is just me. But as a <em>brand</em>. I need a logo or something.</p>
<h2>Dodgey Ball</h2>
<p>I've relegated all the currently written code for Dodgey Ball to a <a href="https://github.com/bytemunch/dodgey-ball-prototype">prototype</a> and started anew on the main project. The meat of the updates for that will wait until the next devlog though!</p>
<p>Aight that'll do for the return of the blog. Seeya.</p>
