<h1 id="dodgeyballdevlog0">Dodgey Ball Devlog #0</h1>
<p>So here I am. Starting a devlog partway through a project.</p>
<h2 id="theproject">The Project</h2>
<p>Intention is to make a fun fast-paced multiplayer game, akin to <a href="https://www.mousebreaker.com/game/sports-heads-football-championship">Sports Heads</a> and games of that ilk. Except it's based on dodgeball rules, and played in 3D space.</p>
<h2 id="sofar">So far…</h2>
<h3 id="gameobject">GameObject</h3>
<p>Let's make a box! With the physics variables from the wonderful <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">Nature of Code</a>, I made the base class for everything in-game to inherit from…</p>
<h3 id="sphere">Sphere</h3>
<p>… and immediately wrote a class that overrides most of that base class. But now we have round. And it's all in 3D, not that I can render that yet.</p>
<h3 id="thethirddimension">The third dimension</h3>
<p>I used to write my own vector functions but thought that it'd be wasteful rewriting them all for another dimension. Enter <a href="https://glmatrix.net/">gl-matrix</a>, with more functionality than I need right now, but the capabilities it seems to have
    should be useful later down the line.</p>
<p>So there's a 3D vector library. But how on earth do I show 3D space on a 2D canvas? God I hope I don't need to think with cameras…</p>
<h3 id="thinkingwithcameras">Thinking with cameras</h3>
<p>Quick google search. <a href="https://www.mamboleoo.be/articles/how-to-render-3d-in-2d-canvas">Pretty example.</a> Checking the code… Okay yeah we're doing projection, let's make that camera.</p>
<p>Initially I made a Camera object per GameObject. Which worked, but in hindsight wasn't the simplest. After moving the Camera out to the main Game class things started flowing. Stuff was being projected into a space correctly! Add a sprinkle of z-sorting
    and there it is, '3D'.</p>
<h3 id="aplayerapproaches">A player approaches…</h3>
<p>So we have 3D balls and boxes. Done, ship it, game's mint.</p>
<p>Nah. We need a player, and my intention is to have them controlled by a gamepad. Hope that API is easy. Google, MDN, aaaaand <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API">yeah</a> it's easy enough! Throw
    the controller axis variables at the Player's force vectors and… Nope. Swap the Y and Z though, and we can move about on our 3D floor. Wew.</p>
<p>Target reticle, throw ball button, pickup ball button, sprint button, all easy enough!</p>
<p>And now add some collision and…</p>

<p>and…</p>
<p><img src="img/blog/sticky-collision.gif" alt="sticky collision" /></p>
<p>AND…</p>
<p><img src="img/blog/ok-collision.gif" alt="ok collision" /></p>
<p>Ok. We can work with that.</p>
<p>So yeah that's where I'm at. Cya.</p>
