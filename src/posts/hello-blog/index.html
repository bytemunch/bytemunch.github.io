<h1 id="helloblog">Hello Blog.</h1>
<p>I'm starting a blog about what I do while developing now. I'm a development blogger. A devlogger.</p>
<h2 id="whytho">Why tho?</h2>
<p>Well I looked at myself, and looked at every other developer online, and other than the social media presence (which will be soon, <em>yay</em>), this was the glaring difference. I also hope to take the procrastination time between solving coding challenges and turn it into something at least semi-productive, time management and all that. There's an intention to do something fun with the presentation too, and opportunity to <strong>INCREASE SEO</strong>, which I can get behind.</p>
<h2 id="stuffimake">Stuff I make</h2>
<p>I create pretty much anything that comes to my head. Mobile merge game based on feces? <a href="https://bytemunch.github.io/apps/shitty-ball-game">Done.</a> Copycat ball-block game from those annoying mobile ads? <a href="https://bytemunch.github.io/apps/shitty-ball-game">Yup.</a> Even more half finished and dumped nearly-ideas? <a href="https://bytemunch.github.io/#funstuff">You bet.</a></p>
<p>Currently I'm working on a little dodgeball game prototype for two or more players. No idea if it's fun yet though as learning proper camera perspective maths has taken precedent, this being my first foray into the deep world of 3D game programming.</p>
<p>I made my <a href="https://bytemunch.github.io/">cool looking website</a> too, inspired by Piet Mondrian's art. Few bugs in the implementation still but <em>eeeeeeh</em> I'll get to those.</p>
<h2 id="end">End.</h2>
<p>So here we are. Welcome to the blog. Which will probably have some sort of snappy title and everything. Feel free to <a href="https://bytemunch.github.io/#about">contact me</a> about whatever, if you feel like it. Ok, bye.</p>
